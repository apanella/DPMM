### Dirichlet Process Mixture Models

This repository contains Matlab code for performing Gibbs sampling inference on Dirichlet Process Mixture Models.


So far, only mixtures of univariate Gaussian distributions are supported.

Some of the supporting code for generating simulated data points was written by [Frank Wood](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/code/index.html).
